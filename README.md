## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## Challenge

The challenge revolved around creating a visually interactive pathfinding algorithm tool, with an initial focus on implementing Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm, an integral part of this project, is a well-known pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It operates by exploring the graph in a systematic manner, iteratively selecting the node with the smallest distance from the starting node and updating the distances to its neighboring nodes. This ensures the discovery of the shortest path from the starting point to every other node in the graph.

The user interface was meticulously designed using HTML and CSS, while the central grid came to life dynamically through JavaScript.

Additionally, a captivating maze generation feature was brought to life using JavaScript, employing a backtracking algorithm. This approach involved making random attempts to navigate to adjacent squares from the current position. When the chosen square had already been visited, a wall was constructed. This process continued until every cell had been visited, ultimately creating a maze.
## Installation
